Version 1.0

Application that displays neutrino data pulled from a local observatory over 24 hour intervals.
(A randomly generated set of 24 integers are generated and stored into an array to simulate the
neutrino data stream pulled from the observatory).

- Data is stored as an array and displayed.

- Users can sort the data numerically.

- Users can manually edit elements of the data.

Version 1.1

Added the following features:

- Sequential Search: Does a linear search, instead of a binary search on the data. Left the Binary
  search option for the sake of showing two different search methods.

- Added a Calculations section with buttons to calculate the data for the following: Mid-extreme, Mode, Average, and Range.
